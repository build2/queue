This is a git repository of the queue.stage.build2.org package repository.
Note that queue.stage.build2.org is transient and volatile and not all package
additions/removals are tracked in this git repository. Note also that old
history may be trimmed from time to time.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as queue.cppget.org but for the
staged version of the toolchain (packages that require the staged version of
the toolchain cannot be published to queue.cppget.org). Upon release all the
packages in this repository are moved to queue.cppget.org.
